# git-release

Minimal tool to create and publish Git release tags following the vX.Y.Z format.

## Usage
- From the repository root: `./git-release`
- The script creates an annotated tag and pushes it to the configured remote.
- If the script is in your PATH, you can run it directly with `git release`


```
$ git release 
    ðŸ“¦ Current version: v0.0.0
    Select release type:
    1) patch
    2) minor
    3) major
    4) cancel
    #? 2
